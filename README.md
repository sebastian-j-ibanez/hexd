Hexd is a CLI program that outputs a hexdump of binary files.

## Building the project
The project can be built with `make`. The `hexd` binary will be generated in the build folder.

***Note:*** If you use clangd, it is recommended to generate clangd config files with [compiledb](https://github.com/nickdiego/compiledb/tree/master).

## Purpose
I'm writing hexd to learn more about binary files. It's also an opportunity for me to write more C.
